Space Madness 404 was a game being made for the Acerola Jam 0. It is no longer going to be developed and will most likely not be submitted, due to a change in my project priorities. It uses a custom texture system that I call "tri-pixels", where the image's pixels are divided into 2x2 squares of pixels, then rendered as if each group was rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise then squished into 4 triangles.
